# vpxcoding_sfh

Single file header form of the arithmetic coder from [libvpx](https://github.com/webmproject/libvpx) as a general purpose compression/decompression algorithm.

The idea of this coding is, given:

1. A bitstream
2. Knowledge about how likely the next bit is to be a 0 or 1

You can optimally code an output bitstream
